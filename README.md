# HTML5 3D Tween

This project was made as a demo to show my team at PROD what was possible with Three.js and TweenJS. Specifically, an animation was made in After Effects for Katy Perry's new website. I built this to take the transformation and keyframe information from After Effects and essentially render the same thing in the browser.

The Katy Perry site was for her new album *Prism* so all of the meshes used in animations were triangles with images mapped onto them, but other shapes could pretty easily be added to the system.
